# Summary

## Goal
Build a personal profile page using data from the 01 Founders GraphQL API. Display your own school information and include SVG‑based statistical graphs.

## Main Tasks
- Authenticate with the platform using JWT.
- Query your data through the GraphQL endpoint.
- Display at least three pieces of user‑related information.
- Create at least two SVG graphs.
- Host the final project online.

## Login Requirements
- Obtain JWT via the `/signin` endpoint using Basic Auth.
- Accept both `username:password` and `email:password`.
- Show an error for invalid credentials.
- Use the JWT as a Bearer token for GraphQL queries.
- Provide a logout option.

## GraphQL Requirements
- Use basic queries, nested queries, and queries with arguments.
- Explore the schema using GraphiQL.
- Useful tables: `user`, `transaction`, `progress`, `result`, `object`.

## Graph Ideas
- XP over time  
- XP per project  
- Audit ratio  
- Pass/Fail ratio  
- Piscine statistics  
- Attempts per exercise  

## Hosting
Host the project on any platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).

## Skills Learned
GraphQL, JWT authentication, UI/UX basics, SVG graphics, hosting, and working with platform data.
